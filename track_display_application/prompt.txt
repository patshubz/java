Create code in Java for a Swing application that reads in track data from a localhost socket at port 532.

The data from the socket is JSON data with the following structure:
```json
{
    "title": "string",
    "artist": "string", 
    "length": "string",
    "image_path": "string",
    "playing?": "boolean"
}
```

The application reads in this data and displays the current playing "song". Specifically, the layout should be such that the image is displayed first, then the title (in a bigger font size than the artist), then the artist, and then the length.

That is, the layout is just a vertical stack of components, and they must be vertically and horizontally centered (make sure program is responsive when resizing occurs).

Note that socket server will output track data at random times, so make sure that new track data causes the display to update instantly.

To denote playing vs not playing status, have the title, artist and length text be glowing when playing, vs normal when not playing.

Requirements:
- Use only standard Java libraries (no external JSON libraries)
- Implement proper error handling for socket connections
- Ensure thread safety for GUI updates
- Make the application responsive and centered
- Include comprehensive test cases
- Support headless mode for testing environments
