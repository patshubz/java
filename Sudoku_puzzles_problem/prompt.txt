# Problem: Sudoku Generation and Solution Game

Create a full implementation of a Sudoku generation and solution game using Java that supports variable board sizes: 4x4, 9x9, and 16x16.

## System Specifications:

- Multi-size Sudoku support (4x4, 9x9, 16x16 grids)
- Puzzle generation with configurable difficulty (number of clues)
- Backtracking algorithm for solving puzzles
- Board validation and constraint checking
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access
- Efficient memory usage and performance optimization

## Required Methods:

- Sudoku(int size) - Constructor that initializes board of specified size
- generatePuzzle(int clues) - Generate solvable puzzle with given number of clues
- solve() - Solve the current puzzle using backtracking algorithm
- printBoard() - Display current board state (empty cells as dots)
- getBoardCopy() - Return deep copy of current board state
- setBoard(int[][] board) - Set board to specific configuration
- isValidPlacement(int row, int col, int num) - Check if number placement is valid

## Constraints:

- Board size must be perfect square (4, 9, 16)
- Use only Java standard library (no external dependencies)
- Handle invalid inputs with appropriate exceptions
- Efficient backtracking with pruning for performance
- Memory-efficient board representation
- Support for empty board initialization

## Performance Requirements:

- 4x4 puzzles: solve in under 1ms
- 9x9 puzzles: solve in under 100ms  
- 16x16 puzzles: solve in under 5 seconds
- Generate puzzles with unique solutions
- Memory usage under 1MB for largest boards

## Example Usage:

Sudoku sudoku = new Sudoku(9);
sudoku.generatePuzzle(32); // Generate 9x9 with 32 clues
sudoku.printBoard(); // Display puzzle
boolean solved = sudoku.solve(); // Solve puzzle
sudoku.printBoard(); // Display solution


Implement all methods to ensure optimal performance and correctness for all supported board sizes.
